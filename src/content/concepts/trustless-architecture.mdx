import KeyExchangeSimulator from '../../components/simulations/KeyExchangeSimulator';

The core innovation of **Ndani** is the elimination of trusted intermediaries in the data supply chain. We achieve this through a "Trustless Architecture" where no single party holds the full private key required to sign transactions or decrypt data.

## The Problem: Administrative Keys

In traditional IoT (and even most DePIN) networks, the device manufacturer or a central server holds the private keys. This means they can:
1.  Sign data on your behalf.
2.  Censor your transactions.
3.  Change the rules of the network arbitrarily.

This is **Administrative Access**, and it is the antithesis of sovereignty.

## The Solution: Keysplitting

We utilize a 2-of-2 Multi-Signature (or MPC) scheme. 
*   **Share A** is generated inside the secure hardware element of the device (Msingi Unit). It never leaves the chip.
*   **Share B** is held by the Farmer (the owner) in their wallet.

To perform any action—like claiming rewards or updating firmware—BOTH shares must participate. The protocol coordinates a signature without ever reconstructing the full key in one place.

## Interactive Simulation

Use the simulator below to understand how the **Device** and **Farmer** cooperate to sign a transaction without trusting each other.

## Technical Details

The specific curve used is **BLS12-381**, allowing for signature aggregation. This enables us to scale to millions of devices without bloating the blockchain state.

### Threat Model
*   **If the Server is hacked**: The attacker only has public keys. They cannot spoof device data.
*   **If the Device is stolen**: The physical attacker only has Share A. They strictly need the Farmer's Share B to move funds.
*   **If the Farmer loses their key**: A social recovery protocol (timelocked) can rotate Share B, provided the Device is still online and consents.
