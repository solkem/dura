A cryptographic method letting you prove something is true without revealing the underlying data.

<Analogy>
The "Where's Waldo" analogy: You prove you found Waldo by showing him through a tiny hole in a large sheet covering the page. The verifier sees Waldo exists, but learns nothing about where he is or what else is on the page.
</Analogy>

## General Examples

- Prove you're over 21 to a bar without showing your birthdate or address
- Prove you have sufficient funds for a loan without revealing your total balance
- Prove you're a citizen of an approved country without revealing which one

## Project Applications

<ProjectExample project="edgechain">
**ProveYieldAboveThreshold circuit** — farmer proves yield > quota without revealing actual harvest amount. The NGO verifies compliance; the farmer keeps their data private.
</ProjectExample>

<ProjectExample project="msingi">
**BRACE protocol** — device proves it's registered without revealing which device it is (1/N anonymity). Uses commitment `C = H(pk || r)` where pk and r remain secret.
</ProjectExample>

## How It Works (Simplified)

1. **Prover** has secret data (e.g., actual yield = 450kg)
2. **Prover** generates cryptographic proof: "I know a value > 400kg"
3. **Verifier** checks proof validity without learning 450kg
4. **Result**: Statement verified, data protected
