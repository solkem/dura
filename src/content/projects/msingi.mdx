## Core Thesis

> **Anonymity requires device-held keys, and ZK-enforced spending policies make device wallets safe.**

This is not a design preference—it's a logical requirement. If a human wallet pays for a device's transaction, the payment links device to human identity, destroying all privacy guarantees.

## Three Pillars

1. **BRACE**: Blind Registration
2. **IAR**: Incentivized Anonymous Relay
3. **ACR**: Anonymous Contribution Rewards

## Integration with EdgeChain

EdgeChain protects farmer identity while <CrossProjectLink project="msingi" concept="brace">Msingi's BRACE protocol</CrossProjectLink> protects the IoT sensors collecting field data. Together, they form a complete privacy stack.

Msingi sensors submit anonymous attestations. These can be consumed by <CrossProjectLink project="edgechain" concept="dual-merkle-roots">EdgeChain's Dual Merkle Root system</CrossProjectLink> to verify IoT data separately from manual farmer reports.
