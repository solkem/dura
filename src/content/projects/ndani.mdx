## Problem

Existing IoT-blockchain systems (IOTA, Helium) allow devices to earn, but payments flow to human-controlled wallets. The device remains an instrument, not an economic agent.

Furthermore, privacy solutions often rely on a trusted gateway to generate proofs. If the gateway is compromised or compelled, privacy is lost.

## Solution

**Ndani** (Swahili for "Inside") moves the entire trust boundary *inside* the farmer's control.

1.  **Device-Held Wallets**: Keys live in the ATECC608A secure element.
2.  **Local Proof Server**: Farmer-owned Raspberry Pi 5 generates ZK proofs locally.

## Core Concepts Used

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| <ConceptLink slug="brace" /> | Anonymous device registration |
| <ConceptLink slug="zkp" /> | Proof of policy compliance |
| <ConceptLink slug="device-wallet" /> | Autonomous economic agency |
| <ConceptLink slug="trustless-architecture" /> | No-gateway proof generation |

## Architecture

```
[Sensor Node] <--- LoRa ---> [Local Pi 5 Proof Server] <--- Internet ---> [Midnight Network]
    |                              |                                           |
(Generates Data)             (Generates Proof)                           (Verifies Proof)
```

## Hardware Stack

<HardwareStack 
  title="Trustless Node (~$163.50)"
  components={[
    { name: "ESP32-S3", function: "Sensor Microcontroller", cost: "$8.00" },
    { name: "ATECC608A", function: "Identity + Wallet Keys", cost: "$2.50" },
    { name: "SX1276", function: "LoRa Transceiver", cost: "$6.00" },
    { name: "Sensors/Power", function: "Env + Solar", cost: "$22.00" },
    { name: "Raspberry Pi 5", function: "Local Proof Server", cost: "$80.00" },
    { name: "Pi Infra", function: "Power + Case + SD", cost: "$35.00" }
  ]}
/>

## Constraints

- **Cost**: Higher per-node cost (~$160 vs ~$50) justified by trustlessness.
- **Complexity**: Requires managing local server infrastructure.
- **Connectivity**: Pi 5 requires internet backhaul.
