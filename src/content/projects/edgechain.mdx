## Problem

96% of African farmers see digital agriculture as beneficial, yet adoption remains minimal due to justified fears of data exploitation. The "Nyakupfuya" (Shona: trapped farmer) faces surveillance from governments, NGOs, and agribusinesses.

## Solution

EdgeChain uses <ConceptLink slug="zkp">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</ConceptLink> and federated learning to transform data from a weapon of punishment into infrastructure for cooperative empowerment.

## Core Concepts Used

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| <ConceptLink slug="zkp" /> | ProveYieldAboveThreshold circuits |
| <ConceptLink slug="kachina" /> | Compact smart contracts |
| <ConceptLink slug="disclosure-regime" /> | Selective compliance proofs |
| <ConceptLink slug="settlement-compliance" /> | Rewards gated by valid proofs |

## Architecture

<ArchitectureDiagram src="/diagrams/edgechain-arch.mermaid" />

## Constraints

- 2G network compatibility (SMS-first)
- 70% of target users live in poverty
- Deep distrust of data collection
- Currently research-only (legal constraints until mid-2027)
